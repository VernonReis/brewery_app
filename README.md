# brewery_app
An app that lets you find the breweries near you! Been to a brewery and don't see it on there? Log in and add it. Make sure to leave a review if you try out any of the breweries.
# approach

We all wanted an app that let us track breweries we have been to an specifically breweries. We also wanted users to be able to add and share about there experiences and so we create the login feature to allow them to review and rate their experience.

# eventually...

We would like to be able to filter the breweries even more especially by what beers the specialize in.

Individual Profiles that let users login and track the breweries they have been to.
